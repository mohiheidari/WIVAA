# WIVAA
The "WIVAA," which stands for "Willfully Insecure and Vulnerable Android Application," is intentionally developed to serve as an educational tool for aspiring Android developers. Its primary objective is to provide a hands-on learning experience regarding common security flaws and vulnerabilities that can be encountered due to improper coding practices in Android app development. This application is designed to be a platform for educating programmers and security experts by demonstrating and explaining these vulnerabilities.

The application categorizes these vulnerabilities into below main areas:

* **Reverse Engineering:** This category likely covers vulnerabilities that can occur when malicious users attempt to reverse-engineer an Android application to understand its inner workings, which can lead to security breaches.
* **Hardcoding:** Hardcoding sensitive information or security-critical data directly into the source code can lead to vulnerabilities. This category probably focuses on teaching developers not to hardcode such information.
* **Insecure Data Storage:** Insecure data storage practices can lead to data breaches. This category may include demonstrations of how data should be securely stored on an Android device.
* **Access Control:** Access control vulnerabilities are related to improper management of user permissions and access to certain features or data within an app.
* **SQL Injection:** SQL injection is a common vulnerability where malicious SQL statements are injected into an application's input fields. This category might cover how to prevent and mitigate SQL injection attacks.
* **Backup and Debug:** Improperly managing backup and debug settings in an Android app can expose vulnerabilities. This category may teach developers how to secure their apps against such issues.
* **C Vulnerabilities:** These vulnerabilities might relate to low-level coding issues or issues in the C/C++ code used within Android apps.
* **WebView:** WebView vulnerabilities are associated with the use of web views within Android apps, which can lead to various security issues. This category likely focuses on securing WebView implementations.


For each vulnerability within these categories, the "WIVAA" application provides detailed explanations and instructions on how to prevent them during the code development process. The goal is to enable users, especially Android developers, to understand and defend against potential attacks on their code by demonstrating real-world security issues and best practices for mitigating them. In this way, the application helps developers learn about security in a practical and hands-on manner, making it a valuable educational tool for improving Android app security.
